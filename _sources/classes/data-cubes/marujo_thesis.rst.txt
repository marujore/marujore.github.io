Gap-filling
~~~~~~~~~~~

The absence of Earth’s surface observations, illustrated in :numref:`Figure %s <fig:vuolo_gaps>`, due to cloudpresence, low temporal resolution and sensor defects (e.g. stripe gaps in Landsat-7images) can limit the full exploitation of time series :ref:`VUOLO et al. (2017)<Vuolo2017>`.

    Illustration of the main radiometric problems occurring when working with satellite data.The first image illustrates the presence of clouds, which affects the surface observation byoptical sensors. The second image illustrates the Landsat-7/ETM+ Scan Line Corrector(SLC) failure, which implies in stripes of missing data. The third image corresponds topartial images, which occurs on the path/rows borders.Source: Adapted from :ref:`(VUOLO et al., 2017)<Vuolo2017>`.


Landsat-7, one of the most utilized satellites,began to present hardware failure on Enhanced Thematic Plus (ETM+) Scan LineCorrector (SLC) in May 2003, resulting in gaps of valid values, or missing data sections on the acquired images. The images collected before such failures are called SLC-on images, and afterwards they are referred as SLC-off. The gaps correspond to a single pixel near the center of a path/row image and can reach 14 pixels in width near image borders :ref:`(STOREY et al., 2005)<Storey2005>`, as illustrated in :numref:`Figure %s <fig:L7_gaps>`.

Maxwell Gap-filling Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


:ref:`Maxwell (2004)<Maxwell2004>` developed a segmentation approach to fill Landsat-7 SLC-off missing data, pairing it with a reference image that does not contains gaps, based on three principles:

- Adjacent pixels are more likely to be similar;

- Groups of the same landscape unit are likely to have similar spectral values;

- Most landscapes remain constant for long periods


This segmentation approach uses a pixel value in its neighboring, delimited by homogeneous regions captured from other close date images :ref:`(MAXWELL, 2004)<Maxwell2004>`. As can be seen in :numref:`Figure %s <fig:maxwell2007>`, :ref:`Maxwell (2004)<Maxwell2004>` approach fills a target image containing gaps, a Landsat-7/ETM+ SLC-off image, by segmenting a reference image, such as Landsat-5/TM or Landsat-8/OLI acquired in a close date. The reference image is segmented and these segments are overlayed in the target image. For each segment containing a gap on the target image the mode value is calculated and used to fill the missing data, resulting in a synthetic image.

The gap-filling through segmentation has been improved further by using several segmentation levels. :ref:`Maxwell et al. (2007)<Maxwell2007>` employed three segmentation levels and a nearest neighbor approach in case the third level isn't enough. In this approach, if a segment is fully contained in the missing data, a segmentation level with segments of a larger area is used to fill the gap :ref:`MAXWELL et al. (2007)<Maxwell2007>`. This approach is exemplified in :numref:`Figure %s <fig:maxwell2007>`.

    A target image that contains gaps, in this case a Landsat-7/ETM+ SLC-off (a); areference image, in this case a Landsat-8/OLI acquired in a close date (b); the referenceimage is segmented (c); the segmentation is overlayed in the target image (d); the modevalue within the segment is calculated and used to fill missing data (e); resulted syntheticimage (f).


Maxwell Gap-filling Approach Adaptation with pixel weighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


:ref:`A multi-scale segmentation approach to filling gaps in landsat ETM+ SLC-off images through pixel weighting (MARUJO et al., 2020)<Marujo2020>`


The proposed method uses the mean value of the segment instead of the most frequently value (mode) suggested in :ref:`Maxwell et al. (2007)<Maxwell2007>`, but also maintaining the use of 3 fixed segmentations. In this case, two images are required in the processing: a target image that's the image with missing observations (gaps) and a reference image acquired in a date close to the target image one. We defined that the acquisition time interval between these images must be less than 9 days, otherwise this gap-filling process is not performed, since the remaining gaps will be filled by the second approach. The :ref:`Baatz et al. (2000)<Baatz2000>`. algorithm was adopted to generate $3$ levels of segmentation, as in :ref:`Maxwell et al. (2007)<Maxwell2007>`. Each segmentation level contains segments of different sizes. Levels 1, 2 and 3 contain small, medium and large segments, respectively.

The Gap-filling procedure is illustrated in :numref:`Figure %s <fig:fill_small_gaps_marujo>`, in which the gap-filling process is performed using pairs of images, a reference and a target, notwithstanding it is applied to an image data cube. First, reference image is segmented. The segmentation produced in the level 1 is superimposed on both target and reference images. For each segment in the target image that contains gaps the mean value of this segment for both images are calculated. In the reference image, each pixel within the segment is divided by its mean, here called pixel weighting. The pixel weighting means how much this pixel is similar to its segment. Back to the target image, the gaps are filled with target image segment mean weighted by pixel weighting. In a case where all pixel values within a segment are null, the filling process is repeated using the next segmentation level, similarly to :ref:`Maxwell et al. (2007)<Maxwell2007>`.

    Segmentation approach fills Landsat-7 SLC-off gap images: (a) a target image containsgaps, in this case a Landsat-7 SLC-off; (b) a reference image is used, such as Landsat-5or Landsat-8 acquired in a close date; (c) the reference image is segmented; (d) thesesegments are applied in the reference image; (e) the segment mean value is calculated andused to calculate pixel weights; (f) the segmentation is overlayed in the target image andthe mean value within the segment is calculated; (g) for each pixel within the segment,its weight is multiplyed by the segment mean; (h) the gaps are filled with this result; (i)a synthetic image is obtained.
