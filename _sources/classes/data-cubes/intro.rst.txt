Data Cubes
++++++++++


Nowadays we have free access to an unprecedentedly large amount of remote sensing images collected by different satellites and sensors with distinct spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. This has motivated the use of time series analysis to extract landscape change information from these images. Datacubes are a new paradigm revolutionizing the way users can interact with EO data and providing a promising solution for the storage, organization, management, and analysis of Big EO data (:ref:`Baumann et al., 2018<Baumann2018>`).
